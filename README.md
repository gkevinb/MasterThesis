## Data-Based Generation of Reliability Models

Aim: Design and implementation of methods for automated derivation of reliability models from data (e.g. A fault tree).

Objectives: Design a reliability model to produce streams of data. Analyze data for patterns using
artificial intelligence and/or machine learning. Derive and reproduce the reliability model from the data.
Compare the original reliability model and reproduced reliability model and evaluate the method of automated derivation.
